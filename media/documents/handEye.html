        Body language is a type of a nonverbal communication in which physical behaviors,<br> as opposed to words, are used to express or convey the information.<br> Such behavior includes facial expressions, body posture, <br>gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space. Body language exists in both animals and humans<br>, but this article focuses on interpretations of human body language. It is also known as kinesics.<br>

            If we are trying to make a good impression – both socially and in business – we often smile and hold contact the other person’s eyes as we shake their hand. <br>The difficulty is that we give off thousands of other unconscious signals through our body language that other people will ‘read’ instantly and instinctively.

           When you communicate, your brain automatically involves your hands to convey thoughts and emotions, without you even knowing it. In that way, your hand body language signals what you don’t say with your words. Being able to properly read body language is a key to ANY successful relationship.</p>

            People say that the eyes are a "window to the soul" - that they can tell us much about a person just by gazing into them. Given that we cannot, for example, control the size of our pupils, body language experts can deduce much of a person's state by factors relating to the eyes.

            </h2>
           <p>
               <mark>Right</mark> It means trying to form a picture in the brain. For example, if you want someone who remembers a purple cow, you see that his eyes make this movement to think about the question.
               Simply she/he is lying.

                    It means trying to remember an image from memory, for example when someone asks you what color is your first home ?? Your eyes make this movement to reflect on the question in order to create your visual images of a previous event

                For example, when someone asks you to imagine what is the loudest voice you may have heard on the pitch, your eyes begin to make this movement to imagine the answer.
